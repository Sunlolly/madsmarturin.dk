    "summary": "I help organizations improve performance by understanding the human side of systems. My background in sociology combined with hands-on technical operations experience gives me a unique lens: I see both how processes should work and why people actually behave the way they do.
    I’m most energized when I’m analyzing complex organizational challenges, designing better ways of working, and engaging stakeholders to make change stick. I thrive in roles that require translating between technical teams and business stakeholders, finding the root causes of operational friction, and building consensus around solutions.",
