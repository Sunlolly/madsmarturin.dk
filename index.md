Hey there!

I'm Mads, a bit of a jack-of-all-trades with a passion for games, the environment, and exploring the great outdoors.

When I'm not glued to my screen conquering epic bosses in Souls-like games (Monster Hunter is my current obsession!), I'm all about unplugging and immersing myself in nature. ️ Fishing, building shelters, and cooking up a storm over a campfire under the stars – that's where I find my zen and hatch my best ideas.

But I'm not all about kicking back, I also enjoy geeking out over space exploration, its endless possibilities, and the mind-blowing tech it's given us.  Plus, I'm a sucker for a good podcast (think 99% Invisible, Freakonomics, Radiolab) that dives deep into the unseen forces shaping our world.

Recently I have set out to learn some basic coding and are starting to contribute to some Open Source Software packages.

So yeah, that's a glimpse into my world. If you're ever up for a chat about games, the environment, space, or anything in between, hit me up!
