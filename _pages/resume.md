## About Me
I am the sword and shield of the team, getting rid of obstacles, as well as shielding them from distractions. I enjoy making sure that my team can do their very best. I excel working in creative multidisciplinary teams of designers, artists, developers and other product managers and can quickly and efficiently translate from vision and strategy to tasks and solutions.

To manage this, I work with people and data first, while breathing resource allocation.

I have experience in consumer-centric community-focused marketing of Live Games (GaaS), agile project management, and conference/event management. I have knowledge of software development practices, as well as being proficient in version-control and source-management. Excel Wiz and Six Sigma Yellow Belt.
